Welcome to the new HorizonEU project AI4PEX!

[AI4PEX](https://ai4pex.org/) aims to improve Earth System modelling to increase the accuracy of climate change projections
and support for implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and the [EUGreenDeal](https://x.com/eugreendeal?lang=en). 

[Follow us](https://x.com/AI4PEX) and join our journey! 

### Project Description

AI4PEX aims at improving the accuracy of Earth system models (ESMs) by improving the representation of Earth system feedbacks, in particular cloud feedbacks, carbon cycle feedbacks and ocean heat uptake, in these models. We will combine earth observations with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in order to achieve more accurate projections of climate extremes and societal impacts.
